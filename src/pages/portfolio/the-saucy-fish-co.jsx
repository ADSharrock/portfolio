            <h2>The Saucy Fish Co</h2>
            <p>The Saucy Fish Co was a brief I took on to redesign the companyâ€™s food packaging. The task was to make it sustainable, but also allow the product to actually be viewable via a window into the packaging, the brief had many requirements including specific colour palette, size, font and more.</p>
            <p>This was my first time ever doing packaging design, I took this on to test my skills in something entirely new to me but managed to make a quality design as an end product. Even going so far into the project that I actually created my own mock up design including a fake fish made from foam and constructed the whole box.</p>
            <p>At the end of the process I succeeded in following the brief, to all its specifications. I had learnt a new skill and took on a new challenge. While confusing at first, I stuck to the brief and persevered, finally creating a quality mock up.</p>
